# Tools to enhance productivity

## General ideas
- being metrics driven; MacOS screen time can be used to measure time in each app; for me Chrome is always the highest, then IntelliJ
- when exploring any new tool start with a mouse and slowly move towards keyboard (most common actions first)

## MacOS
- Raycast 
  - Extensions
    - so many
  - Built-in
    - clipboard manager
    - window manager
- Hammerspoon - a powertool for mac automation
  - moving cursor with keyboard
  - window management 
  - "close window" action that is impossible to perform with MacOS
- AltTab
- CleanShotX

## Chrome
- Extensions
    - vimium/surfingkeys
    - tabXpert
    - "Open Multiple URLs"
    - TabCopy
    - ExtensionManager
    - Tab to window
    - TimeYourWeb Time Tracker
- Built-in
  - command-shift-A
  - opening multiple links fhrough google spreadsheet
  - controlling the tabs with the keyboard
  - selecting multiple tabs with the mouse
